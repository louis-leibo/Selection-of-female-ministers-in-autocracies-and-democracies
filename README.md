# Selection-of-female-ministers-in-autocracies-and-democracies

Using a data set which quantifies the role democracy plays in understanding rates of female participation using WhoGov, I created a logistic regression model to predict whether the share of females in the cabinet will increase or decrease in the next year. After evaluating the model's performance, I then improved the model's performance using multiple techniques. 

Please find explanations of the code and the code in the Quarto mardown and the code in the R script.
